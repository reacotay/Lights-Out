# Project: Lights Out
The code in our project is written with the "C# Coding Convention" in mind. The guideline is used for naming, code structure, and comments in the project. The code in the project does not follow the C# Coding Convention strictly, but rather uses it as guidelines. For more information, read: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions
# Disclaimer!
Before you start the .sln-file, you need to install the font ("BebasNeue-Regular.ttf") that is included in our Git. Program will not work without this installed!
